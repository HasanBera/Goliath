## Notes:

- The Nichrome wire sticking out can be bent to the desired shape. Be careful not to over do it as it can break if bent multiple times. Also keep in mind that this section of the heater will be hot, so place/bend it to a safe position.

- PT1000 Sensor should be installed after the silicon sock. It should be tighen with hand or very gently with a wrench. It is M3 thread and too much torque can lead cause the thread to strip

- Silicon sock is rated up to 300C. While the Goliath can technically handle up to 500C, you should always remove the silicon sock if you plan to use it for ultra high temp. A glass fiber sleeve could be use if you need to isolate it.
